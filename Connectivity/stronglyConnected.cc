/**
 * Given a directed graph, find out whether the graph is strongly connected.
 * A graph is strongly connected if there is a path between every pair of
 * vertices which not necessarily be a _direct_ path.
 *
 * Note: For undirected graphs however, we just do a BFS and DFS starting from
 * any vertex. If BFS or DFS visits all vertices, then the given undirected
 * graph is connected. This simple approach doesn't work for a directed graph.
 *
 * For directed graph, one solution is to do DFS V times starting from each
 * vertex. If any DFS, doesnâ€™t visit all vertices, then graph is not strongly
 * connected. This algorithm takes O(V*(V+E)) time.
 *
 * A better idea can be Strongly Connected Components (SCC) algorithm. We can
 * find all SCCs in O(V+E) time. If number of SCCs is one, then graph is strongly
 * connected.
